# XUnitPriorityOrderer
Order test cases and collections using xunit (ITestCaseOrderer, ITestCollectionOrderer)

following the [guideline of tomdupont](http://www.tomdupont.net/2016/04/how-to-order-xunit-tests-and-collections.html)


ps. tests in XUnitPriorityOrderer's project is working fine
I am trying to create a test project that import the project of "XUnitPriorityOrderer" (I would like to save it in a nuget to reuse in more than one project), but in the test project the tests fail. =(
